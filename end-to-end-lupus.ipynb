      "Precision medicine in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) involves a tailored approach to each patient based on their genetic and epigenetic characteristics, which influence disease pathophysiology and drug response. The goal is to optimally assess SLE patients, predict disease course, and determine treatment response at diagnosis. Ideally, each patient would undergo an initial evaluation to profile their disease, assess the main pathophysiologic pathways through biomarkers, predict the risk of specific organ damage, identify the most suitable treatment, and allow for better follow-up and flare prediction. However, due to the diverse immunopathological abnormalities in different organs/systems in lupus patients, fully applying precision medicine to SLE is still a challenge. Current treatments often involve broadly similar types of drugs, such as steroids, immunosuppressives, and hydroxychloroquine, despite the differences in disease presentation. Future care is expected to involve molecular diagnostics throughout the patient's time course to drive the least toxic combination of therapies.\n",
